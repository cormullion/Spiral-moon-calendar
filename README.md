Spiral moon phase calendar
====================

A spiral moon phase calendar, using Luxor.jlto draw the graphics and calculate the phases.

I've switched to using data downloaded from NASA - the Astrolib calculations are slightly off now (I expect there are some out of data constants, or perhaps the solar system has been shifting recently...).
